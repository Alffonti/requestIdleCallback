    <p id="note">
      By utilizing the <code>requestIdleCallback</code> API, less important
      tasks can run when the browser's main thread is not busy, avoiding
      disruptions to the main thread. This allows users to interact with the
      webpage, such as changing the background, even while the lower-priority
      task is in progress.
    </p>
    <p id="note">
      In real-world scenarios, it's important to be mindful that
      <code>requestIdleCallback</code> can continue running until the page is
      closed or the task explicitly stops. This continuous execution is
      particularly useful for long-running processes like analytics tracking,
      where data collection and transmission can persist throughout a user's
      interaction with the webpage. Proper management and termination of these
      tasks are essential to ensure efficient resource utilization and user
      experience.
